## Get Started in 3 Steps

1. **[Install Ferry](getting-started/install.md)** — download the app for Windows, macOS, or Linux
2. **[Set up Stoat](getting-started/setup-stoat.md)** — create your destination server and get a bot token
3. **[Run your first migration](getting-started/first-migration.md)** — enter your Discord and Stoat credentials, click Migrate

Already have DCE exports? See [Offline Migration](getting-started/export-discord.md) to skip the export step.

## How Long Does It Take?

About **1 message per second** due to Stoat API rate limits:

| Server size | Estimated time |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1,000 messages | ~17 minutes |
| 10,000 messages | ~3 hours |
| 100,000 messages | ~28 hours |

Ferry can **pause and resume** — close it anytime and pick up where you left off.
