## What is Stoat?

[Stoat](https://stoat.chat) (formerly Revolt) is an open-source chat platform — like Discord, but community-owned. You can use the official hosted service or run it on your own server. Ferry moves your entire Discord server there.

New to Stoat? [Create a free account](https://app.stoat.chat) or [self-host your own instance](docs/getting-started/setup-stoat.md).

## How It Works

### Step 1: Enter your credentials

Launch Ferry. You'll need four things:

- **Discord user token** + **server ID** — a token is a secret key that lets Ferry access your account. Ferry shows you how to find both.
- **Stoat API URL** — the web address Ferry uses to talk to Stoat. Use `https://api.stoat.chat` for the official service, or your own domain if you run your own Stoat instance.
- **Stoat user token** — a secret key your browser saves when you log in to Stoat. No bot or app creation needed — you just copy it from your browser. The [step-by-step guide](docs/getting-started/setup-stoat.md) shows exactly where to find it.

### Step 2: Ferry exports your server automatically

Ferry downloads and runs DiscordChatExporter behind the scenes — no manual steps.

### Step 3: Click Migrate

Messages, channels, roles, emoji, and attachments migrate to Stoat.
Each message shows the original author's name and avatar. Pins are preserved.

> Already have DiscordChatExporter (DCE) exports? Ferry also supports [offline mode](docs/getting-started/export-discord.md) — just point it at your export folder.

## How long does it take?

About **1 message per second**. Stoat limits how fast data can be sent to protect the service, which sets this pace. That means:
- 1,000 messages ~ 17 minutes
- 10,000 messages ~ 3 hours
- 100,000 messages ~ 28 hours (run overnight!)

Ferry can **pause and resume** — close it anytime, pick up where you left off.
