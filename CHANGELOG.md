## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Rich CLI progress bars**: Live dashboard with phase progress bar, per-channel message progress bar with ETA, and running stats (messages/errors/warnings)
- **Poll migration**: DCE poll data parsed and flattened into message content as formatted text
- **Sticker image upload**: Locally downloaded sticker images uploaded as message attachments (text fallback for missing/Lottie stickers)
- **Embed media upload**: Embed thumbnails and images from local `--media` exports uploaded to Autumn and attached to embeds
- **Forum categories**: Forum/media channel threads (type 15/16) grouped into dedicated categories named after the parent forum
- **Role rank ordering**: Best-effort second pass sets role rank from DCE position data after creation
- **Permission pre-check**: CONNECT phase verifies server accessibility when using `--server-id` (best-effort, non-fatal)
- **`skip_threads` GUI checkbox**: Exposed in Advanced Options alongside existing skip toggles
- **`attachments_uploaded` counter**: Accurate attachment count in state and reports (replaces deduplicated cache length)
- **GitHub Actions docs workflow**: `docs.yml` builds and deploys MkDocs Material site to GitHub Pages on push to main
- **12 new tests** covering polls, stickers, embeds, forum categories, role rank, permission pre-check — 298 total passing

### Fixed

- **`completed_at` timing**: Report timestamp now set before `generate_report()` runs, giving correct duration
- **`silent` messages**: All migrated messages sent with `silent: true` to prevent notification spam
- **Missing skip types**: `Call` and `ChannelIconChange` messages now skipped during import
- **`ConnectionError` shadowing**: Renamed to `StoatConnectionError` to avoid shadowing Python builtin
- **GUI resume race condition**: Migration start gated behind `asyncio.Event` until user clicks Resume or Start Fresh
- **Embed/sticker upload errors logged**: Failures now recorded as warnings instead of silently swallowed

## [Unreleased-content]

### Fixed

- **Docs quality pass**: ~30 fixes across all 13 documentation pages — wrong port number, stale stoat-py code examples, missing v0.9.0 flags (--dry-run, --max-channels, --max-emoji), incorrect "Skip threads in GUI" claims, placeholder GitHub URLs, wrong report format, stale resume instructions, inaccurate MigrationEvent/MigrationState descriptions
- **GUI placeholder URL**: Changed `api.revolt.chat` to `api.stoat.chat` in the Stoat API URL input field

## [0.9.0] — 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Dry-run mode**: `--dry-run` CLI flag and GUI checkbox run all phases without API calls, producing synthetic `dry-*` IDs for validation
- **Configurable server limits**: `--max-channels` and `--max-emoji` CLI options for self-hosted Stoat instances with custom limits
- **Permission bootstrap**: Automatically patches server default role with ferry minimum permissions on server creation
- **GUI resume detection**: Migrate page detects previous `state.json` and offers resume/fresh-start choice
- **GUI attachment size display**: Validate summary now shows total attachment size in human-readable format
- **8 new integration tests** in `test_migrator.py` covering dry-run, permission bootstrap, and configurable limits — 278 total passing

### Fixed

- **ChannelPinnedMessage sent as content**: Pin notification messages are now silenced and the referenced message is queued for re-pinning in the pins phase
- **Failed messages marked as completed**: Removed duplicate `last_completed_message` assignment that caused failed messages to be skipped on resume
- **Missing periodic state saves**: Messages phase now saves state every 50 messages and after each channel completes

### Changed

- **Shared aiohttp session**: Single engine-managed `ClientSession` replaces per-phase sessions for better connection reuse
- **Removed `stoat-py` dependency**: Project already uses custom raw aiohttp API layer; the SDK was unused weight
- **Removed `aiofiles` dependency**: Listed but never imported anywhere in the codebase
- **Engine refactor**: Extracted `_run_phases` from `run_migration` for readability; fixed silent return-value bugs

## [0.8.1] — 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **skip_threads flag wired to nothing**: `FerryConfig.skip_threads` now filters thread/forum exports in both the channels and messages phases
- **GuildMemberJoin and ThreadCreated not skipped**: Added to `_SKIP_TYPES` so system noise messages are silently dropped per DCE format spec
- **Thread header messages missing**: Flattened thread channels now get a `[Thread migrated from #parent]` system message injected before their content
- **200-channel limit not enforced**: Channels exceeding the Stoat 200-channel limit are now truncated, dropping thread channels first to preserve main channels
- **GUI "Open Report" button broken**: Fixed glob pattern to match the actual `migration_report.json` filename
- **Animated emoji warning missing**: Emits a warning when uploading animated emoji (animation is lost on Stoat)
- **Validate-phase emoji count undercount**: `validate_export` now counts custom emoji from message content in addition to reactions

### Added

- **15 new tests** covering all 7 bug fixes — 270 total passing

### Changed

- Updated `.claude/rules/dce-format.md` to reflect actual `GuildMemberJoin` (skip) and `ThreadCreated` (skip, header injected instead) behavior
